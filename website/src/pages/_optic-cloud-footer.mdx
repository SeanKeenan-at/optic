### [Join the Optic Cloud Beta](https://cloud.useoptic.com/)

We'll be running Optic Cloud through a brief beta period. If you want to take part in the beta and help influence how the team version of Optic is built, [sign up here](https://cloud.useoptic.com/). We're looking forward to meeting you.

Right now we're looking for teams that:
- build internal or partner APIs
- comprised of 3-10 developers
- want to make sure all API changes are reviewed
- plan some changes ("design-first") and want to use Optic to ensure the implementation matches the design

##### We'll open sign-up to the public sometime this fall. We're still figuring out the details of the business model, but can commit now to offering a free-forever version of Optic Cloud that works like the open source project. We do plan to charge for the more advanced collaboration / approval workflows, and the ability to collect evidence from your deployed environments (_i.e._ staging and production).
