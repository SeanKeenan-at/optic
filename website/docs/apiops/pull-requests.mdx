Optic makes API Changes a first-class concern during code review. Every time a Pull Request is opened, Optic comments on the PR with a detailed API Changelog:

## How it Works

When a pull request is opened, a GitHub Workflow triggers the [`optic-changelog`](https://github.com/opticdev/optic-changelog) GitHub Action. The Action compares the current specification in the source branch to the specification in the target branch. The differences are summarized and posted in a comment. It's amazing how many second and third order benefits teams report just from having observability into how their APIs work, and having "API Changes" as an explicit, first-class concern in every Pull Request. Just shining a light on API changes during code review has a strong influence on how teams think about the work theyâ€™re doing.

## Configure the Action

The Action documentation is available in the [`optic-changelog` repository](https://github.com/opticdev/optic-changelog). You'll be able to add the appropriate step to your existing workflows, or create a new workflow, to get the benefits of API changelogs in your PR comments with Optic. If you run into any problems, [please let us know](https://github.com/opticdev/optic/issues/new?title=optic-changelog%3A%20) or, for a demo with the Optic Maintainers before installing the Action, [pick some time on our calendar](https://calendly.com/opticlabs/optic-demo-with-the-maintainers)

### Other Platforms

Right now, as a GitHub Action, `optic-changelog` only supports GitHub and GitHub Enterprise. Are you using another tool and would like to see changelogs come to your workflows? [Let us know](https://github.com/opticdev/optic/issues/new?title=%3Ctool%3E%3A%20optic-changelog%20request) so we can know where to start.
