### Running tests through Optic with Postman

Optic helps you run your existing Postman tests against your project, adding in schema checks for every request and response seen. The tests you have today can help establish the baseline behavior of your API and assert that your API is behaving according to the specification Optic has recorded. Tests are run with a single command:

```sh
api run test
```

## Pre-requisites

Before running tests, you'll need to integrate with your current project. We recommend following the instructions to set up your framework's `api start` command, and to use a middleware integration where available:

<ShowAllFrameworks/>

## Integrating your Postman tests manually

If your project is integrated with Optic using middleware, configuring a test task is as easy as configuring a start task. If using a middleware integration is not feasible, Optic can use your working `start` task to make running your tests through your proxy integration easy.

]}>
<TabItem value="middleware">

### Configuring Optic to run your tests

The middleware integration will assure Optic sees your traffic, no matter if it is sent interactively or through a test collection like with Postman. Since Postman tests are run manually, you will use your current `start` task to start your application and activate the middleware. No configuration changes are needed either in Optic or in Newman.

### Configuring Postman to run your tests

Postman will use the same definition that was already set up to intercept traffic with `api start`. You'll need to confirm Postman is ready to send requests to the **inboundUrl** defined in the `optic.yml` `start` task. Open Postman and check the URL and port of your requests. We suggest parameterizing your URL in some fashion, and using Postman Environments to set the values of these parameters. For example, below we have an environment `Optic on 3001` that defines a **baseUrl** value of `http://localhost:3001`. This matches the **inboundUrl** of our start task in `optic.yml`:

```yml title='optic.yml'
name: "todo-js"
tasks:
  start:
    command: node server.js --watch db.json --routes routes.json --port $PORT
    inboundUrl: http://localhost:3001
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
As this is a manual integration, you'll use `api start` to start up your API and run your Postman tests by hand. When testing, substitute the `api start` or `api run start` commands for `api test` or `api run test`. Postman testing with Optic can be automated using [Newman](/reference/capture-methods/tools/newman).
