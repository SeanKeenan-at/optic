### Running tests through Optic with Newman

Optic helps you run your existing Newman tests against your project, adding in schema checks for every request and response seen. The tests you have today can help establish the baseline behavior of your API and assert that your API is behaving according to the specification Optic has recorded. Tests are run with a single command:

```sh
api run test
```

## Pre-requisites

Before running tests, you'll need to integrate with your current project. We recommend following the instructions to set up your framework's `api start` command, and to use a middleware integration where available:

<ShowAllFrameworks />

## Integrating your Newman tests manually

If your project is integrated with Optic using middleware, configuring a test task is as easy as configuring a start task. If using a middleware integration is not feasible, Optic can use your working `start` task to make running your tests through your proxy integration easy.

### Configuring Optic to run your tests

The middleware integration will assure Optic sees your traffic, no matter if it is sent interactively or through a Newman test collection. We recommend a `test` task, which will tell Optic to use the previously defined `start` task with the **useTask** parameter and run our test with the **command** parameter. For example, if you would normally run a Newman collection with `newman run collection.json --environment environment.json`, your `test` task would be defined in `optic.yml` like this:

```yml title='optic.yml'
name: "todo-js"
tasks:
  start:
    command: <your start command>
  test:
    useTask: start
    command: newman run collection.json --environment environment.json
```

We recommend a `test` task, which will tell Optic to use the previously defined `start` task with the **useTask** parameter and run our test with the **command** parameter. Your Newman collection will need to be configured to run against the **inboundUrl** defined in the `start` task. This is a great reason to configure a Postman Environment for your application - by parameterizing your requests, you can easily configure how your Newman tests run. For example, if you would normally run a Newman collection with `newman run collection.json --environment environment.json` and you have an `environment.json` Newman configuration to point against http://localhost:3001, your `test` task would be defined in `optic.yml` like this:

```yml title='optic.yml'
name: "todo-js"
tasks:
  start:
    command: <your start command>
    inboundUrl: http://localhost:3001
  test:
    useTask: start
    command: newman run collection.json --environment environment.json
```
