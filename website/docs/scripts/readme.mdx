### What you'll need to know

<p>To integrate with {frontMatter.title}, you'll need the following information:</p>

- **Readme username and password** to log in with the `rdme` command line tool (we'll install that later).
- **Readme project subdomain** such as `your-api-project`.

<h3>Preparing your {frontMatter.title} setup</h3>

<ExpandDocs title="Set up your Readme project" defaultOpen={false}>

The first step to integrating with Readme is setting up your API project. If you've already done this, you can skip this step.

Head over to [Readme.com](https://readme.com/) and sign up for a new account (or log in). Follow the flow to create a new project, and choose a subdomain name. Keep this handy - this and your login credentials are both required by the Readme command line tool, `rdme`, to upload your specification generated by Optic.

</ExpandDocs>

<p>Once you have an active project, there's no further setup required on your {frontMatter.title} account.</p>

<h3>Integrating {frontMatter.title} with Optic scripts</h3>

Scripts are defined in your project's `optic.yml` file. We'll add a script definition to call the Readme CLI and update your documentation:

```yml title='optic.yml' {7-11}
name: "todo-js" 
tasks:
  start:
    command: node server.js --port $PORT
    inboundUrl: http://localhost:3001
	
scripts:
  readme:
    command: rdme login && rdme swagger $OPENAPI_JSON
    dependsOn: rdme
    install: npm install --global rdme
```

### Running your Optic Script for the first time

To ensure the dependency is installed, run:

```sh
api scripts readme --install
```

This will check for the Readme CLI `rdme`, and if it isn't found, install it. Once installed, Optic will generate an up to date OpenAPI file, log you in to Readme, and upload the latest specification.

To update your Swagger or OpenAPI file, run the following:

	rdme openapi FILE --key=<key> --id=60fadcc5f900ff000f9b1365
```

:::tip
The Readme CLI will suggest that you run the command with a key parameter. That is not necessary - you don't need to make any changes to your `optic.yml` file. If you wish, you may update your `optic.yml` to use this flag and remove the need to run the login command every time, though keep in mind that this is a secret key tied to your identity. Follow your organization's best practices for managing keys and identities, such as having every team member store their own key value in a local environment variable on their workstation or using secrets in your CI provider, such as GitHub Secrets. Don't commit this key to your repository!

### Running your Optic Script generally

You don't need to run your scripts command with the `--install` flag every time. Once installed, you can run:

```sh
api scripts readme
```

You will be prompted to log in, and your latest specification will be uploaded to Readme. If you opt to use the Readme `--key` flag, you can even have this run automatically such as in your CI pipeline on merges.
