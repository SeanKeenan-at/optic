title: Integrate with your existing tools using Scripts
slug: /share/scripts

import { ShowAllScripts } from '../../src/components/ShowAllScripts';

You may have some tooling already in place that you use to manage your API development lifecycle. This can include documentation servers, mocks for testing, or even API deployments from OpenAPI specifications. Optic can integrate with your existing systems through its Scripts feature, which generates an up to date OpenAPI 3.0 specification and runs a command or script to process the specification. We've included some examples from popular integrations:

<ShowAllScripts />

These are just some examples. If you need a different integration, or need to customize your integration, please check out our [Script definition](/reference/optic-yaml/scripts) reference. It has everything you need to know to write your own integration. Are we missing something important, of have you built something really cool you'd like to share?
