**Collecting traffic from real environments is in Beta**.

Join the Beta and help chart the course for how Optic works in real environments. If chosen, we'll work closely with your team to set up Optic to monitor your APIs as they are running in staging, development and even production environments.

Each week you will be sent reports created from observing the live traffic + comparing it to your API spec. Just tell us what information you're looking for and we'll build a report for it :)
