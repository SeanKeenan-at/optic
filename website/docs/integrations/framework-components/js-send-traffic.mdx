### Send traffic via the middleware

To start documenting your API at this point you just need to run `api exec "npm start"`, replacing `npm start` with whatever command you use to start your application.

The command will start a server on an unused port to receive the captures and set `OPTIC_LOGGING_URL` for the middleware to send to the correct location.

Optic will observe your API traffic locally, and report on the routes and traffic shape it sees in the Optic dashboard. The next step is to start [building your baseline specification](/docs/using/baseline)

:::note
You can use `api start` without it being a proxy as if it were `api exec`, if you use just the `command` property they behave the same.
```yaml
start:
	command: npm start
```
In this instance `api start` behaves the same as `api exec "npm start"`.
