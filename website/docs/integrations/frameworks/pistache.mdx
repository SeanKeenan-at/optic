Optic is easy to use with Pistache.io, no special library or large code changes required.

## `api start` Command

Let's say we have a simple Pistache.io server that we usually develop with on localhost:3005.

### Optic needs to know how to start our API

Our optic.yml file would include our start command (such as `./application`).

``` yaml
name: C++ API
tasks:
    command: ./application
    inboundUrl: https://localhost:3005
```

### Optic also needs the ability to control what port our API starts on

Optic injects a `$PORT` environment variable for our application to listen on when `api start` is run. Wherever you start your API server, set the port on which it will bind with this environment variable:

#### Before
```
int main() {
    Pistache::Address addr(Pistache::Ipv4::any(), Pistache::Port(8000));
    auto opts = Pistache::Http::Endpoint::options()
        .threads(1);

    Http::Endpoint server(addr);
    server.init(opts);
    server.setHandler(Http::make_handler<HelloHandler>());
    server.serve();
}
```

#### After
```
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string>
...

int main() {
    int port = 8000;
    if (getenv("PORT")) {
            std::string s = getenv ("PORT");
            port = std::stoi(s);
    }
    Pistache::Address addr(Pistache::Ipv4::any(), Pistache::Port(port));
    auto opts = Pistache::Http::Endpoint::options()
        .threads(1);

    Http::Endpoint server(addr);
    server.init(opts);
    server.setHandler(Http::make_handler<HelloHandler>());
    server.serve();
}
```

## Verifying with `api run start --verbose`

Which will give you advanced debugging logs on the console, and report common errors. Run some traffic through your application: we recommend at least 5 requests. You should seee Optic report the requests on the console. When you're confident that everything is ready, you can run the command without the `--verbose` flag.

Should you need any more help, or want to chat about the process, please reach out to us. You can schedule a [quick chat with the maintainers](https://calendly.com/opticlabs/maintainer-office-hours) or [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/opticdev/optic/issues/new?title=API%20Init:%20).

## Run your API through Optic

At this point you should be ready to run `api start` and document your API with Optic! Optic will observe your API traffic locally, and report on the routes and traffic shape it sees in the Optic dashboard. The next step is to start [building your baseline specification](/docs/using/baseline)
